NOTES:
------
1. Connect Arduino ground to common ground for all components
2. IR sensor typically needs +5V, GND, and signal connected to pin 3
3. Button connects between pin 4 and ground (internal pull-up used)
4. Camera trigger connects to pin 5 and can be used to trigger a camera's remote shutter
5. Printer trigger connects to pin 6 and can signal a printer to start printing
6. Status LED connects between pin 13 and ground via current-limiting resistor (220-330 ohm)

   CONNECTIONS SUMMARY
   ------------------
   Digital Pin 2 -> Relay control signal
   Digital Pin 3 -> IR Sensor/Loop Detector signal (LOW when vehicle detected) 
   Digital Pin 4 -> Button (connect to GND when pressed)
   Digital Pin 5 -> Camera trigger output (HIGH when active)
   Digital Pin 6 -> Printer trigger output (HIGH when active)
   Digital Pin 13 -> Status LED (+ve with current-limiting resistor)
   
   VCC -> +5V power
   GND -> Common ground

CAMERA TRIGGER CIRCUIT (OPTIONAL):
----------------------------------
If connecting to a camera with a remote shutter input, you might need an opto-isolator
or relay to safely interface the Arduino with the camera. A basic circuit would be:

Arduino Pin 5 ----> 220Ω resistor ----> LED side of opto-isolator
                                            |
                                            v
Camera shutter input <------------ Transistor side of opto-isolator

PRINTER TRIGGER CIRCUIT (OPTIONAL):
----------------------------------
Similar to the camera circuit, if connecting directly to a printer's trigger input:

Arduino Pin 6 ----> 220Ω resistor ----> LED side of opto-isolator
                                            |
                                            v
Printer trigger input <------------ Transistor side of opto-isolator

Note: Most implementations will use the desktop application to handle camera and printing
functionality rather than direct hardware connections.
